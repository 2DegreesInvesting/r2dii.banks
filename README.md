The think tank ‘2DII’ (2 Degrees Investing Initiative;
<https://2degrees-investing.org/>) maintains a set of packages designed
for banks. Together, those packages implement in R a methodology known
as ‘PACTA’ (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment), which
enables users to measure the alignment of financial portfolios with
climate goals. This package makes it easy to install and load all ‘2DII’
packages for banks in a single step.
